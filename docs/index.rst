Introduction
------------

DiddiScript is a language made to be easy to extend and enough powerful to help
your workflows. DiddiParser 2 is the current parser for this language, written
with pure Python and packaged as open source. To get the parser, you can use Pip:

::

    python -m pip install diddiparser2

Also, this package provides more than a rough parser CLI. It also provides a console
(which is some kind of a REPL), an editor GUI, a standard library for DiddiScript, and
even an implementation for Python.
